TWO FRIENDS & BEAR 
 ---------------------

 Once upon a time there were two friends named as Vijay and Raju. On a holiday they went walking into a forest, 
enjoying the beauty of nature. Suddenly they saw a bear coming at them. 
They became frightened.

  Raju, who knew all about climbing trees, ran up to a tree and climbed up quickly.
He didnâ€™t think of Vijay.Vijay had no idea how to climb the tree.
