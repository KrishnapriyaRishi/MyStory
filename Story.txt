TWO FRIENDS & BEAR 
 ---------------------

 Once upon a time there were two friends named as Vijay and Raju. On a holiday they went walking into a forest, 
enjoying the beauty of nature. Suddenly they saw a bear coming at them. 
They became frightened.

  Raju, who knew all about climbing trees, ran up to a tree and climbed up quickly.
He didn’t think of Vijay.Vijay had no idea how to climb the tree.

Vijay thought for a second. He’d heard animals don’t prefer dead bodies,
so he fell to the ground and held his breath.The bear sniffed him and thought he was dead. 
So, it went on its way.
